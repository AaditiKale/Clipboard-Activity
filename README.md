# Clipboard-Activity
This project is about creating an Android app called Clipboard Activity using Android Studio. The app helps users keep track of everything they copy (like text or links) on their phone. Normally, when you copy something, it replaces the last item you copied. This app saves all copied items so users can view and reuse them later.
